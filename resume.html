										<p class="section_title">Overview</p>
										<p class="section_text">It is important for users to do their own research on Web3.0 world since scams are such a widespread problem for the industry. On the NFT Marketplace AtomicHub, there was a two-level system with checks (like the Twitter blue check) to refer the collection’s maturity level, which was manually reviewed by our customer support colleague. It performed as some protection layer especially for new users. However, we have received many feedbacks about improving the verification system.</p>

										<p class="section_title">Problems</p>
										<p class="section_text">We've been getting regular feedback from the community that they didn't find the check system fair nor transparent. But the checks we had in place were affecting how users make purchases. Also, new users were having a hard time figuring out how the system works. Therefore, we needed to make changes to how the verification system works.
										<br>Our customer support team has already come up with two ideas to replace the current verification system: One to change the wording of the current system for a minimal change; the other to use a badge system.</p>

												<li>As a short-term goal, the focus was on the first proposal — upgrade the wordings of the verification system to have a quick solution. We gathered nameings through a workshop to make it simpler to understand. A focus group study was conducted to evaluate the perception of the current verification system and the new proposal.</li>
												<li>Creators were gathered via a quick call in Discord. We started with simple scalable questions that they could answer quickly in the chat. Small discussions conducted afterwards to gather further feedback/improvement ideas.</li>
												<li>In the meanwhile, a survey linked inside of a blog article was released for regular users to evaluate.</li>

												<li>Synthesis from the focus group and surveys indicated that the new wording can slightly improve the unfair perception for the average users. However, creators still sensed the lack of clarity in the upgrade process, and they found it unfair because the fundamental process hasn't changed.</li>
												<li>Therefore, no big win from the short-term fixes. In fact, they might even cause confusion when we eventually make bigger changes to the system. Product team has decided to skip the quick fix and directly proceed with the second proposal.</li>
