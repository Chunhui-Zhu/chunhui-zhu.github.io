										<p class="section_title">Overview</p>
										<p class="section_text">AtomicHub, as an NFT marketplace, places significant emphasis on its filtering feature. Filters served as the backbone of user navigation, helping them anchor what they're exactly looking for.<br>
										Expanding to multiple blockchains means we needed to improve our Filter system for both current and new users, especially on mobile devices. This case study explains how I facilitated AtomicHub with the first step of the growth to multiple chains and enhanced user experiences on the feature “Filters”, which is part of a larger project “Multi-chain Marketplace”.</p>

										<p class="section_title">Problems</p>
										<p class="section_text">The challenge was that the Filter feature on AtomicHub was the most beloved feature on the platform and has remained the same since the platform started. Long-time users were used to where Filters were positioned and how they could be used to help with searching, which means changing the filters could upset them. Simultaneously, it was crucial to ensure that the updated Filters were user-friendly for new users coming from other blockchains, especially from the first added chain IMX. 
										<br>Moreover, many users have reported that the Filter feature on mobile devices lacked intuitiveness and efficiency. It was also the right time to update Filter’s mobile version.</p>

							<div class="section">
										<p class="section_title">Goal</p>
										<p class="section_text">"As a user, I want the updated Filters to work smoothly with multiple blockchains regardless of the devices. It should stay easy for me, a long-time user, and be simple for new users from other chains.”</p>

												<p class="section_text">Please keep in mind that all these assessments were aimed at the entire marketplace rather than just the Filter feature. The Filter update served as our initial step towards going multichain, so the resources allocated for the Filter update might appear heavier than they actually were.</p>
											<ol class="section_list">
												<li>Current Market Evaluation: I used Hotjar to study Filter usage patterns, employing Heatmaps to compare user behavior with our design intent and Recordings to identify potential frustrations.</li>
												<li>Competitors Analysis: I analysed both general multi-chain marketplace Filters (unfortunately all excluding IMX) and IMX marketplaces to understand especially how the Filter works.</li>
												<li>User Interviews: I interviewed users from multi-chain marketplaces (via userinterviews.com) and IMX marketplaces (from Reddit Community). This helped us assess their NFT and blockchain interests, as well as their marketplace usage patterns, especially regarding Filters.</li>

											<ol class="section_list">
												<li><strong>Market Evaluation</strong>: Users mostly engaged with Filters as we designed, with collection Filters being the most clicked and range selection the least. One exception was the 'sales history' button, which ranked second in clicks, so we’ve decided to make it more visible.</li>
												<li><strong>Multi-Chain Marketplaces</strong>: Filters were primarily used for art collections or PFP collectibles. Users typically filtered one chain at a time and used Filters when a specific collection was selected. Filters were generally useful, but categories weren't prioritised, and price ranges could be confusing.</li>
												<li><strong>IMX Marketplaces</strong>: Filters were more game-oriented. Users found them clunky and not user-friendly, suggesting improvements like color coding or better section separation.</li>

													<li>Select the most visually effective option for each Filter.</li>
													<li>Desktop users assess a prototype reflecting their choices in the context of the marketplace; mobile users test two simplified prototypes to identify their preferred interaction style.</li>

												<li><strong>GA4 & HotJar</strong>: After two weeks post-launch, I assessed the Filter redesign using GA4 data and HotJar Heatmaps. This helped us identify potential issues and quick fixes. Overall, the results aligned with our expectations and showed improved mobile usage data.</li>
												<li><strong>User Interviews</strong>: In the first week of the launch, community feedback on Discord raised complaints about the extra clicks and the complexity of the new mobile Filters. To address this, I conducted user interviews with both community users and users from our database. </li>

Consequently, GA4 data reflected a significant increase in mobile usage.</li>

												<li>Immediate negative feedback in the community follows any launch of a new feature. This initial feedback can sometimes mislead us into thinking the feature isn't performing as intended, triggering us to consider quick fixes. However, it's crucial to recognise that users require time to get used to the new feature and provide meaningful feedback, for example within a two-week range.</li>
