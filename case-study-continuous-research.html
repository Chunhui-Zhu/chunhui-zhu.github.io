										<p class="section_text">Continuous UX Research is some ongoing exploratory UX research, that complements research on a broader scale. It operates across various levels of granularity, timeframes, scopes and is executed via weekly rituals instead of extensive projects. It helps us keep track of customers in a fast-moving industry, and it helps us de-risk in our design efforts, enabling us to focus on “design the right thing” rather than just “design the thing right.”</p>

										<p class="section_title">Problems</p>
										<p class="section_text">Traditionally research usually concentrates on a particular project, with specific objectives, targeted questions, and extended timeframes.<br>
										New features were either introduced based on product plans or emerged from particularly negative insights derived from research synthesis and community feedback. A well-defined user feedback loop wasn't established in the company, resulting in various teams independently gathering feedback from diverse channels, thereby leading to duplicated efforts. As a solution, setting up an ongoing continuous research framework can streamline this process, enabling us to gather valuable insights within the context of lightweighted day-to-day workload.</p>

												<li>Workshop was organised involving all teams responsible for collecting user inputs from various channel. During this workshop, we visually presented and discussed our existing methods of gathering, sharing, and documenting user inputs. The aim was to identify the pros and cons of the current workflow, develope an improved process, assign responsibilities, and consolidate all inputs within a single repository. </li>
												<li>A subsequent workshop was conducted to establish the structure of the Airtable Repository. This structure adopted a consistent format to gather feedback and feedbacks will be reviewed during bi-weekly research and product meetings.</li>
												<li>Initiated a daily routine that involves transferring user feedback from platforms like Discord, Twitter, and Canny to Airtable. This process would be completed within a 15-minute timeframe.</li>

											<p class="section_text">Net Promoter Score, which is based on a one-minute survey, gives insights about customer loyalty by measuring customers’ willingness with one question “On a scale from 0 - 10, how likely is it that you would recommend us to friends, colleagues or business associates?”.</p>
											<ul class="section_list">
												<li>promoters - who provide ratings of 9 or 10</li>
												<li>passives - who provide ratings of 7 or 8</li>

											</ul>
											<p class="section_text">We conducted the NPS survey on a monthly basis during the first week of the month for the initial 3 months. Following that, we changed to conducting the survey every two months. Our performance has been quite positive, achieving an NPS of 50+ with over 60% of respondents being promoters. (For reference: an NPS score above 9 is considered good, above 20 is considered great, and above 50 is considered excellent.)</p>

												<li>Running the NPS survey on a monthly basis could give users the feeling that they're taking the same survey repeatedly. As a solution, we decided to adjust the survey interval after the initial 3 months.</li>
												<li>While the NPS provides a certain view of user satisfaction, it's important to complement this method with deeper user interviews.</li>
												<li>Sharing positive NPS results has bolstered product confidence across the entire company. This suggested that user input sharing sessions should encompass the broader company context rather than solely focusing within the product team.</li>

											For certain ninja projects' launch, we have tried weekly user interviews to swiftly gather instant user feedback. This approach allowed us to bypass the waiting time for user recruitment, alleviating time constraints for the team and supplementing user input even for urgent fixes.<br>
											However, the continuous automated recruitment has been paused due to the ongoing setup of the participant database.
